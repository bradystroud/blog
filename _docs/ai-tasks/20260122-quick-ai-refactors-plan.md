# 📝 Blog + Video Plan — Parallel AI Refactors with Sub-Agents

## 🎯 Goal

Create a blog post (and companion video) showing how a painful modular-monolith refactor becomes fast and scalable by using:

- OpenCode
- Multiple sessions
- Sub-agents
- A shared markdown “source of truth”

End result:
- A public demo repo
- Screenshots + short video
- A practical workflow people can copy

---

## 🏗️ Deliverables

- [ ] Public demo repository  
- [ ] Refactor plan markdown file  
- [ ] `agents.md` / `subagents.md` file  
- [ ] Screenshots of agents running in parallel  
- [ ] 3–5 min screen-recorded video  
- [ ] Blog post published  

---

## 🧪 Demo Setup

### Repo
- [ ] Pick modular/vertical-slice template  
- [ ] Ensure multiple independent modules  
- [ ] Push clean baseline commit  

### Refactor
- [ ] Choose a mechanical, cross-cutting change  
- [ ] Verify it touches many files  
- [ ] Write clear refactor rules  

---

## 📄 Files to Create in Repo

- [ ] `/docs/refactor-ai.md` — master refactor plan + checklist  
- [ ] `/.opencode/agents.md` (or equivalent) — sub-agent definitions  

These become key artefacts for the post + screenshots.

## ⚙️ Experiment Flow (What you’ll show)

### Phase 1 — Single agent
- [ ] One OpenCode session  
- [ ] One agent working linearly  
- [ ] Capture slowness + baseline  

### Phase 2 — Multiple sessions
- [ ] Spin up 2–3 sessions  
- [ ] Assign each a module  
- [ ] All referencing same checklist  

### Phase 3 — Sub-agents
- [ ] Create sub-agent config  
- [ ] Tag agent instead of pasting prompts  
- [ ] Let it spawn workers  
- [ ] Capture parallel work happening  

Target:
> “I effectively had ~15 AI agents working on the same refactor.”

## 🎥 Video Plan

### Shots to capture
- [ ] Repo structure  
- [ ] Refactor plan markdown  
- [ ] Sub-agents file  
- [ ] Starting new sessions  
- [ ] Agents running in parallel  
- [ ] Checklist updating  
- [ ] Git diffs / commits  

### Rough structure
1. The pain  
2. Old way  
3. Parallel sessions  
4. Sub-agents breakthrough  
5. What this unlocks

## 📝 Blog Structure

### 1. The pain
- Modular monolith
- Repetitive refactor
- Traditionally awful

---

### 2. AI makes it possible (but not yet fast)
- Single session
- One file at a time
- Still linear

---

### 3. Parallel sessions
- Multiple windows
- Each on a module
- Shared markdown brain

---

### 4. Sub-agents changed the game
- Encoded the process
- One command → many workers
- Coordination via checklist

---

### 5. Final setup
- Multiple sessions
- Each spawning sub-agents
- All following the same plan

---

### 6. Live demo
- Repo
- Files
- Screenshots
- Video

---

### 7. What this unlocks
- Cheap architecture changes
- Massive refactors become normal
- Dev becomes orchestrator

---

### 8. Warnings
- Burns credits
- Needs strong plans
- Review still matters

---

### 9. Takeaway
- Write plans machines can execute
- Parallelism > better prompts
