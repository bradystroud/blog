      Welcome.

      I'm a Software Engineer at SSW, where I have the privilege of working
      alongside talented developers, helping them grow and refine their skills
      to become exceptional consultants. With a passion for finding optimal
      solutions, I thrive on implementing processes that can scale seamlessly
      with the company's growth.


      With a strong technical background, automating processes comes naturally
      to me. I love to streamline workflows, allowing devs to focus on what they
      do best â€“ deliver high-quality solutions.

      The best part about being a software developer is having cool ideas, then
      being able to turn them into real projects.  \
         These are some of my favorites.
