    subheading: Problem solver at heart — software engineering is my my tool of choice.
    body: >
      I’m a software engineer because I love solving problems and building
      things that work better. Code is just the medium — what really excites me
      is improving how things function, whether that’s a process, a product, or
      a team.


      I’m a Senior Software Engineer with strong expertise in .NET, Blazor, MAUI
      (was Xamarin), and React. Beyond hands-on development, I manage projects
      end-to-end — driving process improvements, setting engineering standards,
      and helping teams deliver with clarity and consistency. I’m a big believer
      in open-source tech for its flexibility, transparency, and the speed it
      brings to innovation.


      Beyond the keyboard, you’ll usually find me far from my laptop - running,
      mountain biking, climbing, or wakeboarding. Recently, I've been loving
      working on some renovation/new house construction projects with friends.
