  - body: "# About Me\n\nI’m a software engineer because I love solving problems and building things that work better. Code is just the medium — what really excites me is improving how things function, whether that’s a process, a product, or a team. \n\nI’m a Senior Software Engineer with strong expertise in .NET, Blazor, MAUI (formerly Xamarin), and React. Beyond hands-on development, I manage projects end-to-end — driving process improvements, setting engineering standards, and helping teams deliver with clarity and consistency. I’m a big believer in open-source tech for its flexibility, transparency, and the speed it brings to innovation.\n\nRecently, I’ve been diving deep into AI technologies like Semantic Kernel, LangChain, and OpenAI — experimenting with real integrations that enhance automation and intelligence in client solutions. I’m always looking for practical ways to bring cutting-edge tools into production systems.\n\nMy blend of technical leadership and management experience helps bridge the gap between code and business outcomes. As a certified Scrum Master, I keep teams aligned, projects on track, and quality front of mind. I take pride in being someone clients can rely on to solve complex challenges and deliver results that make an impact.\n\n\U0001F30A Outside of work, you’ll usually find me far from my laptop - running, mountain biking, climbing, surfing, or wakeboarding. I’m happiest when I’m moving, exploring, or learning something new. Recently I've been loving working on some renovation/new house construction projects with friends.\n"
