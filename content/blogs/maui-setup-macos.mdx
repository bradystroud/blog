Getting started with .NET MAUI on macOS is straight forward once you know the tooling you need. With a single installation you can build and debug on iOS, Android, macOS.

## Install the .NET MAUI workload

First install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) via the installer or with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install dotnet-sdk
```

Then add the MAUI workload:

```bash
dotnet workload install maui
```

This command downloads all of the MAUI templates and the underlying platform libraries.

## Install Xcode

To build and run iOS or Mac Catalyst apps you need Apple’s build tools. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the App Store and run it once to accept the license agreement. MAUI will use Xcode’s toolchain for compiling and deploying to iOS simulators or devices.

## Install Android Studio

MAUI relies on Android SDKs and emulators from Android Studio. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and during the setup, install the latest Android SDK and create a device emulator. The MAUI templates reference the Android tooling automatically once it is installed.

## Ready to build

After installing the MAUI workload, Xcode and Android Studio you are ready to create your first project:

```bash
dotnet new maui -n MyFirstMauiApp
cd MyFirstMauiApp
dotnet run
```

This launches a build for the default platform. You can target iOS or Android specifically using the `-f` flag (`net8.0-ios`, `net8.0-android`, etc.).

That's it! With these three components installed on macOS you can start building and debugging .NET MAUI applications across all supported platforms.

## Windows

To test your MAUI app on Windows, you can use a VM or dual-boot setup with Windows.
