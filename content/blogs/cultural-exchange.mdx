In 2024 I had the opportunity to spend 2 months living and working in France.

I stayed in Strasbourg and worked with SSW's French team, and it was an experience that went far beyond what I expected.

## A Different Kind of Trip

I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to France - not only did I learn a lot about the country, but having easy access to the rest of Europe was an amazing bonus too! I got to see 5 different countries!

I had been to France before with family, but this trip was completely different. I was using my own money, I had to work out how to get around and plan my own schedule, and the biggest thing was I was traveling alone for the first time. It was a great experience that pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me so much about independence and adaptability.

## The People Made All the Difference

Thanks to Gilles Pothieu and Hugo Pernet for your helpfulness while I was in Strasbourg üôèüèº Having local colleagues who were willing to show me around and help me navigate both work and life in France made all the difference.

## Reflection

I am very thankful to have the opportunity to travel with help from SSW.

For anyone considering a similar opportunity, I'd say go for it. The challenges you'll face traveling alone are exactly what make the experience so valuable.

Some of the highlights of my trip included:
