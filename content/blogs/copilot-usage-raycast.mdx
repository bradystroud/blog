title: Tracking Copilot Usage Without an API (Raycast + Month Progress)
description: GitHub Copilot has no public API for usage tracking. Here's how I built a 2-keystroke solution using Raycast Script Commands to avoid burning quota early in the month.

GitHub Copilot shows usage only in the UI. No API, no programmatic access, just a bar chart buried in settings. Easy to burn through your monthly quota by day 13 when you can't quickly check where you stand.

I needed a fast, low-friction way to sanity-check my usage without opening browsers or scraping brittle HTML. Here's how I solved it with Raycast Script Commands and a mental model based on calendar progress.

## The Problem

**GitHub Copilot's limitations:**
- Usage data lives only in the UI at `github.com/settings/copilot/features`
- No public API for remaining credits or usage percentage
- Easy to burn quota early in the month without realizing it
- Checking requires: open browser → navigate to settings → find Copilot → read chart

**What I needed:**
- Fast feedback (1-2 keystrokes)
- Zero maintenance (no scraping, no auth tokens)
- Mental model: "I'm 42% through the month → usage bar should roughly match"

---

## Solution: Raycast Script Commands

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is a macOS launcher (like Spotlight or Alfred). Script Commands let you run bash scripts with hotkeys.

**My approach:**
1. Calculate % through the current month (calendar days)
2. Show a macOS notification with the percentage
3. Auto-open the Copilot usage page in the browser
4. Quick visual sanity check: "42% through month → usage should be ~40-45%"

**Why Raycast instead of a CLI alias?**
- Always available (global hotkey)
- Notifications > terminal output
- Dead simple to install (drop script in `~/.config/raycast/scripts/`)

---

## Implementation

The script is available on GitHub. Save it as `~/.config/raycast/scripts/copilot-usage.sh`.

If you want to share/fork it, it's in this repo: https://github.com/bradystroud/raycast-scripts/blob/main/copilot-usage.sh

## UX Flow

1. **Hit hotkey** (I use `Cmd+Space` → type "copilot")
2. **Notification appears:** "Month Progress: 42.0% (day 13/31)"
3. **Browser opens** to `github.com/settings/copilot`
4. **Quick sanity check:** Usage bar at ~45%? I need to pace myself...
5. **Done** - Close tab, back to work.
