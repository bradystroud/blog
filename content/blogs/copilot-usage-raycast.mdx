title: Tracking Copilot Usage Without an API (Raycast + Month Progress)
description: GitHub Copilot has no public API for usage tracking. Here's how I built a 2-keystroke solution using Raycast Script Commands to avoid burning quota early in the month.

GitHub Copilot shows usage only in the UI. No API, no programmatic access, just a bar chart buried in settings. Easy to burn through your monthly quota by day 13 when you can't quickly check where you stand.

I needed a fast, low-friction way to sanity-check my usage without opening browsers or scraping brittle HTML. Here's how I solved it with Raycast Script Commands and a mental model based on calendar progress.

## The Problem

**GitHub Copilot's limitations:**
- Usage data lives only in the UI at `github.com/settings/copilot`
- No public API for remaining credits or usage percentage
- Easy to burn quota early in the month without realizing it
- Checking requires: open browser → navigate to settings → find Copilot → read chart

**What I needed:**
- Fast feedback (1-2 keystrokes)
- "Good enough" accuracy (calendar days, not perfect billing cycles)
- Zero maintenance (no scraping, no auth tokens)
- Mental model: "I'm 42% through the month → usage bar should roughly match"

---

## Why Not Just Use the API?

Because there isn't one.

GitHub exposes **org-level Copilot metrics** via the REST API, but **personal usage** is UI-only. Scraping the settings page is possible, but it's fragile (HTML changes break it), requires auth tokens, and violates ToS.

I wanted something that would work in 2027 without breaking.

## Solution: Raycast Script Commands

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is a macOS launcher (like Spotlight or Alfred). Script Commands let you run bash scripts with hotkeys.

**My approach:**
1. Calculate % through the current month (calendar days)
2. Show a macOS notification with the percentage
3. Auto-open the Copilot usage page in the browser
4. Quick visual sanity check: "42% through month → usage should be ~40-45%"

**Why Raycast instead of a CLI alias?**
- Always available (global hotkey)
- Notifications > terminal output
- Dead simple to install (drop script in `~/.config/raycast/scripts/`)

## Implementation

Here's the complete script. Save it as `~/.config/raycast/scripts/copilot-usage.sh`:

If you want to share/fork it, it's in this repo: https://github.com/bradystroud/raycast-scripts/blob/main/copilot-usage.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Required parameters:
# @raycast.schemaVersion 1
# @raycast.title Copilot Usage
# @raycast.mode silent
# @raycast.packageName Developer Utils

# Optional parameters:
# @raycast.icon 🤖
# @raycast.description Check GitHub Copilot usage vs month progress

# Calculate % through the month using Python
MONTH_PERCENT=$(python3 <<EOF
from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()
day = now.day

# Get the last day of the current month
if now.month == 12:
    next_month = datetime(now.year + 1, 1, 1)
else:
    next_month = datetime(now.year, now.month + 1, 1)

from datetime import timedelta
last_day = (next_month - timedelta(days=1)).day

percent = (day / last_day) * 100
print(f"{percent:.1f}% (day {day}/{last_day})")
EOF
)

# Show notification
osascript -e "display notification \"Month Progress: $MONTH_PERCENT\" with title \"Copilot Usage Check\""

# Open Copilot usage page
open "https://github.com/settings/copilot"

echo "Month Progress: $MONTH_PERCENT"
```

**Make it executable:**
```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/raycast/scripts/copilot-usage.sh
```

## UX Flow

1. **Hit hotkey** (I use `Cmd+Space` → type "copilot")
2. **Notification appears:** "Month Progress: 42.0% (day 13/31)"
3. **Browser opens** to `github.com/settings/copilot`
4. **Quick sanity check:** Usage bar at ~45%? I need to pace myself...
5. **Done** - Close tab, back to work.
