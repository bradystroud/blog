Recently, I was working with some PowerShell scripts in VS Code and ran into a frustrating error:

> "Can't find the PowerShell session."

After some digging, I discovered the fix: VS Code couldn't locate my PowerShell executable. The solution was to point VS Code directly to the PowerShell exe path in the settings.

## How to Fix It

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl + ,` or `Cmd + ,` on Mac).
2. Search for `powershell.exe` or **PowerShell: Executable Path**.
3. Manually set the path to your PowerShell installation.

## Where to Find PowerShell (if installed with Homebrew)

If you've installed PowerShell via Homebrew, here's where you'll find it on macOS:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/pwsh
```

(or `/opt/homebrew/bin/pwsh` if you're on Apple Silicon).

That's the file path you'll want to paste into VS Code's PowerShell settings.

Thats all - once you set the correct path, restart VS Code and the error should be gone. Happy scripting!
