OpenAI’s model names (e.g., o4, 4o, 4.1) are confusing and change often.  
This is my quick reference for picking the right model for any task 🧠⚡️

## OpenAI Chat Model Cheat-Sheet (Updated October 2025)

**Legend:**  
- 🟢 current & recommended  
- 🟡 active but phasing out  
- 🔴 legacy / deprecated  

| Status | Model | Release / Change | Strengths / Best Use-Cases | Trade-offs / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 | **GPT-5** | Aug 2025 | Unified “smart” (fast) + “thinking” (deep) routing model. Best for general work, reasoning, coding, and RAG. | Variable latency; cost scales with reasoning depth. |
| 🟢 | **GPT-4.1** | 14 Apr 2025 | Flagship API model — top coding, logic, and 1 M token context. | Pricier than mini/nano. |
| 🟢 | **GPT-4.1 mini** | 14 Apr 2025 | ~90 % of 4.1 accuracy at lower price/latency; great default. | Slightly less reasoning depth. |
| 🟢 | **GPT-4.1 nano** | 14 Apr 2025 | Ultra-fast and cheap; still supports 1 M context. Perfect for classification / autocomplete. | Loses nuance and creativity. |
| 🟡 | **GPT-4o / 4o mini** | May-Jul 2024 | Multimodal (text + image + audio) real-time chat. | Slightly weaker reasoning than 4.1 series. |
| 🟡 | **GPT-4 Turbo / 3.5 Turbo** | 2023-2024 | Older “Turbo” line optimized for speed & cost. | Sunsetting by late 2025. |
| 🟡 / 🔴 | **GPT-4.5 (“Orion”)** | Feb 2025 → retired mid-2025 | Bridge between 4o and 4.1; good reasoning. | Deprecated for GPT-5 and 4.1. |
| 🔴 | **GPT-4 (base)** | 14 Mar 2023 | Original 4-series model (text-only). | Retired Apr 2025. |
| 🔴 | **GPT-3.5 (base)** | 2022 | Early RLHF (ChatGPT v1). | Obsolete; small context. |
| 🔴 | **GPT-3 / 2 / 1** | 2018 - 2020 | Historical models for context. | Too limited for modern tasks. |

### Decoding the Names

- **GPT** = _Generative Pre-trained Transformer_  
- **Major number** (3, 4, 5) → architecture generation  
- **.1 / .5** → mid-cycle refresh or fine-tune  
- **o** → **o**mni (multimodal I/O line)  
- **mini / nano / high** → size vs accuracy trade-off  
- **Turbo** → throughput-optimized snapshot  
- **MMDD** in ID (e.g. `gpt-4-0613`) → training-snapshot date
