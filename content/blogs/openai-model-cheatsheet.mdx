Let's be honest: OpenAI's model names are a moving target. Just when you've learned what “GPT-4 Turbo” means, along comes “GPT-4o,” “o4-mini,” or “GPT-4.1”—and sometimes, the same model gets renamed or quietly replaced. The pace of releases is relentless, and the branding is anything but intuitive. Even experienced developers and AI enthusiasts find themselves double-checking docs, changelogs, and blog posts just to figure out which model is current, which is best for their use case, and what all those suffixes actually mean.

If you feel like you're always a step behind, you're not alone. This cheat sheet exists because the model zoo keeps growing, the names keep shifting, and the only constant is change. Hopefully, this guide helps you cut through the confusion and pick the right model for your needs—at least until the next round of updates drops!

This is a living document and I've probably made some mistakes while writing it, so feel free to suggest changes or additions. I'll keep it updated as OpenAI rolls out new models and features 🚀

### Decoding the names

- **GPT**-= _Generative Pre-trained Transformer_.
- **Major number** (1,-2,-3,-4,-4.1…) → new architecture/train run.
- **.5 / .1** → mid-cycle fine-tune refresh.
- **o** → **o**mni (multimodal I/O).
- **o-series without “GPT”** (o1,-o3,-o4…) → separate reasoning line; letters are branding, numbers track generations.
- **mini / nano / high** → trade speed/cost vs accuracy.
- **Turbo** → snapshot tuned for throughput/cost.
- **-MMDD** (e.g., `gpt-4-0613`) → training-snapshot date.
