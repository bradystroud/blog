I've often given the same advice to friends, family, and colleagues, so I decided to document it.

I began my career as a Software Developer but soon transitioned into a role involving recruitment, training, management, and mentoring of new starters. People often ask how I made this shift. While it felt natural at the time, looking back, I can identify what facilitated the transition.
Anyone can land a job in any industry and have a simlar transition with the right approach. Here are my tips:

1. Be visible
2. Understand your company's goals
3. Be memorable
4. Do the job you want, not the job you have

## 1. Be visible

Ensure your boss knows who you are and what you do. This will build your credibility and make your name well-known.

- Take credit - Put your name on everything you create. Document a process in a Word doc? Put your name at the top.
- Share ideas - If you have an idea, show it to your boss (Good ideas might be implemented; bad ideas will teach you valuable lessons and put your name on their radar.)

**Note:** It's important to identify the right person to target your visibility too. It should be the person with the power to promote you.

## 2. Understand your company's goals

Every company has goals, whether explicit or implicit.

- Seeing lots of new hires? Think about potential process issues that could arise.
- Not many projects? Consider how to boost sales.

## 3. Be memorable

Similar to Tip 1, Stand out by being unique.

For me, this was easy. I work in tech, but most of my friends are tradies. Sharing my weekend stories made me memorable because they found them unusual.

## 4. Do the job you want, not the job you have

If you want to move into management, start managing.

When new starters joined my office, I offered help frequently. New people always need help but might not ask. After solving a few problems, they began coming to me for assistance, turning me into a mentor. This naturally led to more responsibility.
